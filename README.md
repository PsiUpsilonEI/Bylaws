### Section 2: Risk Manager

It is the responsibility of the Risk Manager to ensure that at the first house meeting of the semester with mandated potential new member attendance the chapter discusses all risk management policies we hold ourselves to for their continued relevance and practicality.

In the event that there are still people drinking when the sober brother wishes to retire, they may have another brother assume the responsibilities and authority of sober brother for the remainder of the evening, however they are not allowed to leave until a brother agrees to take over, or the alcohol is once again locked away and the people have started to sober up.
